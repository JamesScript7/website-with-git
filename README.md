# Workshop: Website with Git


## Part One: git commands

Type out a step-by-step for which git commands you have to type out to start a project and to make commits.

## Part Two: Website w/ Git

Build a VERY basic web page. As you go, make commits at the following points:

- After you put in the basic HTML scaffolding (`<DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`)
- After you add some body content
- When you add a stylesheet with some styles
- After you add a navigation bar
- When your project is complete

## Grading Criteria

We're looking for your understanding of git here but if you would like to challenge yourself push to github and submit the assignment with the github repository URL. Be sure that you show at least 3 commits in their project (go for all 5) and write out all git commands correctly.
